## **Features**

### **1. Testing Support**
- **UI Testing**: Driven by Selenium with Page Object Model (POM).
- **BDD Support**: Cucumber for behavior-driven testing.
- **Test Management**: TestNG ensures structured and organized execution.

### **2. Reporting**
- Extent Reports and Cucumber Reports for detailed test insights.
- Logs available in `logs/automation.log` for debugging.

## **Framework Structure**

### **1. UI Testing**
- **Pages**: Implements POM design (`com/bestbuy/PageObjectRepository`).
  - Pages include `LoginPage`, `CreateNewAccountPage`, etc.
- **Step Definitions**: Cucumber step implementations (`com/bestbuy/stepdefinitions`).
- **Runners**: Test execution using Cucumber-junit (`com/bestbuy/runners`).

### **2. Utilities**
- **ConfigProperties**: Reads data from any properties file.
- **ExtentReportManager**: Manages all the extend report configurations.
- **LoggerManager**: Manages the logger instance for complete automation.
- **ScreenShotManager**: Manages all the related screenshot methods to interact with webdriver.
